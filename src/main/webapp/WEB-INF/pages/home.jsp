        <p><strong>Blu-ray</strong> or <strong>Blu-ray Disc (BD)</strong> is a digital data storage format for optical
            discs. It was designed to supersede the DVD format, in that it is capable of storing high-definition and
            ultra high-definition video resolution
            (2160p). The plastic disc is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick, the same size as DVDs and CDs.[5]
            Conventional (pre-BD-XL) Blu-ray Disc discs contain 25 GB per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being the
            industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple-layers (128 GB)
            are available for BD-XL re-writer drives.[6] The name "Blu-ray" refers to the blue laser (specifically, a
            violet laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is
            possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium
            for video material such as feature films and physical distribution of video games for the PlayStation 3,
            PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of
            multimedia formats.</p>
        <p>High-definition video may be stored on Blu-ray discs with up to 2160p resolution (3840×2160 pixels), at up to
            60 (59.94) fields or 60 frames per second. DVD discs had been limited to a maximum resolution of 480i (NTSC,
            720×480 pixels) or 576i (PAL, 720×576 pixels).[7] The format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association,
            a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. Sony unveiled
            the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003
            in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release in June 2006. During the high
            definition optical disc format war, Blu-ray Disc competed with the HD DVD format. Toshiba, the main company
            that supported HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,[8] releasing its own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009.[9]
            According to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the US were slower in the first two years
            than DVD software sales. Blu-ray faces competition from video on demand.</p>
